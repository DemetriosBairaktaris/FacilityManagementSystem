Project Details:

The goal for this project was to implement the business/domain layer for a facility management system.
The funtional requirements were given to us as use cases.

We also have a psuedo Data Access Layer that our domain layer can make calls to.
To simplify things for the project, the DAL puts and gets various objects to and from a HashMap rather
than a true database.

Spring is also used to manage dependencies. This allows the code to only rely on interfaces and not on
concretions.
